                <h1><a>Abstract:</a></h1>
                <p>Lip reading is a method for understanding words or speech without the use of audio through visual interpretation of face, mouth, and lip movement. This research validates the usage of machine learning, specifically using neural networks, to create a system for automatically reading lips. Two different CNN architectures were trained, and a web application for real-time word prediction using the top-performing model was developed.</p>

                <h1><a>Implementation:</a></h1>
                <p>The implementation involves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for lip reading. The methodology includes data gathering, pre-processing, developing a neural network architecture, training, and evaluation. Key components of a CNN model, such as convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, are utilized for feature extraction and prediction.</p>

            <h1><a>Introduction:</a></h1>
            <p>Even experienced lip readers have found lip reading troublesome. This research aims to solve lip reading challenges using machine learning techniques, providing potential benefits for speech recognition in noisy environments and aiding hearing aid technologies. The research explores the use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for lip reading, addressing the diversity of languages and speech articulations.</p>

            <p>Colors<br> I've chosen two contrasting pastel gray shades. The darker shade is utilized for the background and title, enhancing the title against the lighter background. The lighter shade is selected for the headings and paragraphs to ensure clear visibility against the darker background.
            </p>
            <p>Fonts<br> I've carefully selected handwritten fonts for this webpage to evoke personality and charm. By incorporating these fonts, the page exudes a unique and inviting aesthetic, captivating visitors' attention and encouraging engagement with the content.
            </p>
            <p>Borders<br> The precise application of varying borders, with curved edges and no pixels except on the bottom side, gives the title a dynamic underline effect, enhancing its visual impact and effortlessly guiding the viewer's focus.
